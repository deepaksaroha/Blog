        "content": "React Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features without writing a class. They were introduced in React 16.8 to allow you to use state and other React features without writing class components. The most commonly used hooks are useState and useEffect.\n\nThe useState hook lets you add state to functional components. It returns an array with two elements: the current state value and a function to update it. The useEffect hook enables you to perform side effects in function components. It serves the same purpose as componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount in React classes.\n\nCustom hooks allow you to extract component logic into reusable functions. They are a powerful way to share stateful logic between components without adding more components to your tree. When creating custom hooks, remember to start their names with 'use' to follow React conventions.\n\nHooks follow specific rules: only call hooks at the top level of your function, and only call hooks from React function components or custom hooks.",

        "content": "Next.js is a React framework that enables functionality such as server-side rendering and static site generation. It provides an excellent developer experience with features like fast refresh and automatic routing.\n\nOne of the key features of Next.js is its file-system based routing. Simply create a file in the pages directory, and it automatically becomes a route. This intuitive system makes building complex applications much simpler. The framework also supports dynamic routes through files with square brackets.\n\nNext.js offers different rendering methods: Static Generation (SSG), Server-side Rendering (SSR), and Client-side Rendering. SSG generates HTML at build time, making it perfect for blogs and marketing sites. SSR generates HTML on each request, ideal for constantly updating data.\n\nThe framework includes built-in CSS and Sass support, API routes for backend functionality, and automatic image optimization. It also provides excellent TypeScript support and incremental static regeneration for updating static content.",

        "title": "CSS Grid vs Flexbox",
        "content": "CSS Grid and Flexbox are two powerful layout systems in CSS that serve different purposes. Flexbox is designed for one-dimensional layouts, either in a row or a column, while Grid is perfect for two-dimensional layouts with both rows and columns.\n\nFlexbox excels at distributing space and aligning content within a container. It's particularly useful for navigation menus, centering elements, or creating flexible component layouts. The main axis in Flexbox can be either horizontal or vertical, and items can wrap to create new lines if needed.\n\nCSS Grid, on the other hand, allows you to create complex grid-based layouts with rows and columns. You can precisely control the placement of items, create gaps between cells, and even make items span multiple rows or columns. Grid's ability to handle both dimensions simultaneously makes it perfect for page layouts.\n\nWhile both systems can be used independently, they work exceptionally well together. For example, you might use Grid for the overall page layout and Flexbox for individual components within that layout. Understanding when to use each is key to creating efficient, responsive designs.",

        "content": "ES6 (ECMAScript 2015) brought significant improvements to JavaScript, making the language more powerful and expressive. Arrow functions introduced a concise syntax for writing function expressions, particularly useful for callbacks and methods that don't need their own 'this' context.\n\nClasses provided a clearer, more familiar syntax for object-oriented programming in JavaScript. While they're technically syntactic sugar over the prototype-based inheritance, they make the code more readable and maintainable. The class syntax includes constructors, methods, and inheritance using the 'extends' keyword.\n\nTemplate literals allow for multiline strings and string interpolation using backticks and ${expressions}. This feature makes it much easier to create complex strings and HTML templates. The destructuring assignment syntax lets you unpack values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables.\n\nES6 also introduced let and const for block-scoped variables, making it easier to manage variable scope. Modules with import and export statements help organize code better, and the spread/rest operators provide new ways to work with arrays and objects.",

        "title": "Building REST APIs with Node.js",
        "content": "Node.js provides an excellent platform for building RESTful APIs with its event-driven, non-blocking I/O model. When combined with Express.js, it becomes a powerful tool for creating robust and scalable APIs.\n\nThe first step in building a REST API is setting up your Express server and defining your routes. Express middleware handles tasks like parsing request bodies, managing CORS, and handling authentication. Proper route organization helps maintain clean, maintainable code.\n\nImplementing CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) forms the backbone of most REST APIs. Each operation corresponds to different HTTP methods: POST for creation, GET for reading, PUT/PATCH for updates, and DELETE for removal. Using async/await with try-catch blocks helps handle asynchronous operations cleanly.\n\nError handling and input validation are crucial for building reliable APIs. Libraries like Joi can validate request data, while proper error middleware ensures consistent error responses. Adding documentation with tools like Swagger makes your API more accessible to other developers.",

        "title": "GraphQL vs REST",
        "content": "GraphQL represents a paradigm shift in API design, offering an alternative to traditional REST endpoints. Unlike REST, where each endpoint returns a fixed data structure, GraphQL allows clients to request exactly the data they need using a single endpoint.\n\nOne of GraphQL's main advantages is its ability to prevent over-fetching and under-fetching of data. Clients can specify the exact fields they need, reducing unnecessary data transfer. This is particularly beneficial for mobile applications where bandwidth might be limited.\n\nThe schema definition in GraphQL acts as a contract between client and server, clearly defining available data and operations. This self-documenting nature makes it easier for teams to collaborate. GraphQL also handles relationships between data efficiently, allowing clients to traverse related data in a single request.\n\nHowever, GraphQL isn't always the better choice. REST might be more suitable for simple APIs or when you need HTTP caching. Understanding the trade-offs between REST and GraphQL is crucial for choosing the right approach for your project.",
